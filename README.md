# Crude Oil Price Analysis

This project analyzes historical crude oil price trends (1861-2022) for the Strathcona Resources internship application. It uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, analyze, and visualize data from the Kaggle Crude Oil Prices dataset.

## Files

- `OilProductionAnalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis and visualizations.
- `crude-oil-prices.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `crude_oil_price_trend_yearly.png`, `crude_oil_price_change_trend.png`, etc.: Visualization outputs.

## Key Insights

- Highest price: $702.38/barrel in 2022
- Lowest price: $3.08/barrel in 1861
- Largest absolute price change: $199.76 in [Year of Max Change]
- Largest percentage price change: 251.98% in [Year of Max Percent Change]
- Average price across all years: $86.27/barrel

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Python 3.11+ and the required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
3. Open `OilProductionAnalysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run all cells.
